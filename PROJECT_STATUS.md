## 1. The application at a glance

Utility & facility operations dashboard for **Muscat Bay** (Oman): water,
electricity, STP plant, assets, contractors, HVAC, pest control and fire safety
in one Next.js app backed by Supabase.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Production | **https://muscatbay.work** (aliases: www.muscatbay.work, muscatbay.vercel.app) |
| Deploys | Vercel project `muscatbay`, auto-deploy on push to `main` (root: `muscatbay/app`) |
| Repo | `ARahim900/muscatbay`, default branch `main` |
| Backend | Supabase project `utnlgeuqajmwibqmdmgt` (ap-northeast-1) — Postgres 17, Auth, Realtime |
| Stack | Next.js 16 · React 19 · TypeScript 5 · Tailwind 4 · Recharts 3 · GSAP 3 (+ ScrollTrigger) · shadcn/ui · PWA (service worker `public/sw.js`, cache `muscatbay-v6`) |
| Auth | Supabase email/password + Google OAuth (added 2026-08-28 — "Continue with Google" on `/login` and `/signup`; instant sign-up, no confirmation-email round-trip; **inert until the Google provider is enabled in the Supabase dashboard**, see §4); client-side route protection (`components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`); RBAC role column (2026-05-13 migration) |
| Tests / checks | Vitest (156 tests), ESLint, `tsc --noEmit`, `next build` — all green as of 2026-07-10 |

Users are operations staff on control-room tablets (dark mode primary) and
executives (dashboard KPIs). Live data — there is no demo mode.

## 1a. Code layout (reorganised 2026-07-25)

The tree was reorganised on **2026-07-25** along Base44's organisation
principles, adapted to the App Router (Base44's literal `src/pages/` is
incompatible with Next.js routing, so the *principles* were applied, not the
folder names). Full detail: `muscatbay/app/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`.

Two rules now hold, and new work must keep them:

1. **`app/` holds routes only.** Thirteen component/helper files that had been
   added next to their `page.tsx` (`app/contractors/renewals.tsx`,
   `app/firefighting/equipment-register.tsx`, `app/assets/asset-charts.tsx` …)
   moved to `components/<module>/`. `app/` is now nothing but Next.js file
   conventions.
2. **One predictable home per module**, named as the UI names it:
   `components/{assets,contractors,dashboard,electricity,firefighting,hvac,stp,water}/`.
   `components/gulf-expert/` was renamed **`components/hvac/`** — the module is
   called HVAC everywhere in the UI. (`functions/api/gulf-expert.ts` keeps its
   name: it maps the `gulf_expert_*` Supabase tables and `mobile/` imports that
   exact path.)

Supporting changes:

- **Data layer barrels.** Three strictly ordered tiers, one barrel each, each
  carrying a header comment that documents the layering: `entities/` (types) →
  `functions/` + `functions/api/` (isomorphic readers) → `actions/`
  (`'use server'` writers). `actions/index.ts` re-exports `'use server'`
  modules **and nothing else** — merging the readers in would pull
  `next/headers` into the client graph. `functions/api/index.ts` now also
  exports the fire-safety and HVAC readers, which it had been missing.
- **Naming standardised on kebab-case.** `components/water/DailyWaterReport.tsx`
  → `daily-water-report.tsx`; `components/NotificationProvider.tsx` and
  `components/providers.tsx` (the only two loose files at the components root)
  → `components/providers/{notification-provider,app-providers}.tsx`.
  `hooks/useThing.ts` deliberately keeps camelCase — the React convention,
  applied consistently across all 8 hooks.
- **`components/inspection/findings-register.tsx` → `components/shared/`**, so
  the inspection toolkit is one folder rather than a folder that shadowed
  `components/shared/inspection.tsx`.
- **17 orphan files deleted** (2,113 LOC): 7 app-authored components with zero
  importers (`liquid-area-chart`, `data-quality-badge`, `filter-tabs`,
  `loading-spinner`, `page-transition`, `status-indicator`, `welcome-card`),
  8 unused shadcn primitives (`alert-dialog`, `calendar`, `combobox`,
  `dropdown-menu`, `field`, `popover`, `scroll-area`, `sheet` — re-add any with
  `npx shadcn@latest add <name>`), plus `components/ui/input-group.tsx` and
  `lib/status-colors.ts`, both already dead. This follows the earlier ~5,400
  LOC dead-code removal.
- **`mobile/` untouched and still green.** `entities/`, `lib/` and
  `functions/api/` were deliberately *not* moved, because the Expo app consumes
  them via Metro `watchFolders` + a `@/*` alias. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes in
  `mobile/` after the reorganisation. `lib/status-colors.ts` was safe to delete
  — it is not in mobile's import set.

The reorganisation was a pure move/rename/re-export refactor: no behaviour,
logic, styling or copy changed. `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, 203/203 Vitest tests
and `next build` were all green before and after.

## 2. Module status

| Module | Route | State | Data source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard (command deck) | `/` | ✅ Live | aggregated from module tables | KPI deck, live ops strip, module status rail; animated hero brand mark since 2026-07-04 — exact-geometry SVG (`components/brand/brand-mark.tsx`, measured from the flat brand master) with GSAP ScrollTrigger choreography (assembly on load, scroll-scrubbed teal light sweep + layer drift, reduced-motion safe); flat mark render at `public/brand/mark-frame.png` doubles as the Higgsfield video start frame. **2026-07-06:** STP "Treatment Overview" chart now live-syncs from `stp_operations` (table added to the realtime publication — see §3), matching the water chart's auto-update behaviour. The chart mirrors the main STP Plant page — every month plotted as-is (last 8), no dashboard-only completeness filter — so it reflects the same reality as the module page. The standalone asset-count KPI card + "Total Assets" activity item were removed (the deck is water/electricity/STP performance). A sixth hero KPI — **Electricity Cost** (OMR, at the flat 0.025 OMR/kWh tariff) — sits beside Electricity Usage so electricity has a cost figure to match STP's economic-impact card and the deck tiles cleanly again (2×3 / 6-across) instead of a 5-card grid with one empty slot |
| Water — Monthly | `/water` (Monthly tab) | ✅ Live, fully dynamic | `water_meters` + `water_monthly_consumption` | Balance A1/A2/A3, zones, buildings, DC, exceptions; months appear automatically (see §3). **2026-07-06:** Zone Analysis now surfaces the **primary/trunk network (A1→A2)** as a first-class item — the loss *above* every zone that the per-zone drill-downs structurally can't show. It has a top-of-section banner, its own dropdown option + drill-down (KPIs, main-bulk-vs-reached bar, monthly A1-vs-A2 trend, and an A1 reconciliation table of Σ zone-bulk + Σ direct vs main bulk), plus an Exceptions-register row when the A1→A2 gap breaches target or goes negative (A2>A1 → main-meter/timing issue). Live A1→A2 gap has run 0–41% month-to-month (even negative in Jan/Feb-26), so it is material and reading-sensitive. The long tables (A1 reconciliation, individual meters, exceptions register, main database) now carry a **10/20/50/All rows selector** so operators cap what shows instead of scrolling a fixed box (drill-down tables default to 20; the database defaults to All) |
| Water — Daily | `/water` (Daily tab) | ✅ Live, rebuilt 2026-07-04 | `water_daily_consumption`, `water_loss_daily/summary` | Zone-first leak-detection dashboard, 5 sections mirroring Monthly: Zone Watch (looping briefing ticker, severity zone cards, zone×day loss heatmap), Zone Analysis (drill-down + MTD cumulative balance), Direct Connections, Daily Database (meter×day ledger, flags, CSV), Exceptions & Actions (auto register: high loss, negative balance, missing L2, rising-loss signature, spikes, zero-streaks). Daily balances were distribution-level only (L2 vs ΣL3) until Apr-26 — since then the NAMA main bulk lands daily in `water_daily_consumption` under account `C43659` ("Main Bulk (NAMA)", zone `Main_Bulk`); fed by CSV upload / Grafana sync. **2026-07-10:** Zone Analysis L3 meters table now shows the meter **name** (from `meter_name`, e.g. "Building FM", "Irrigation Tank (Z01_FM)") in the Meter column, with the account number kept in the Account column — previously both columns repeated the account number. **2026-07-23:** Direct Connections gauges upgraded from the two-ring L2+DC vs L3+DC pair to a **three-stage supply chain — Main Bulk (C43659) → zone bulks + DC → individual meters + DC** — with the loss written between each pair, mirroring the monthly A1→A2→A3 balance (`MAIN_BULK_ACCOUNT` in `lib/water-accounts.ts`); days/months without a main-bulk reading (pre-Apr-26) show an explicit "no reading" note and fall back to the distribution-level pair instead of faking a zero supply. The DC trend chart below the gauges now plots the same series day-by-day — Main Bulk line vs a zone-bulks-+-DC line (gap between them = daily trunk loss), with the DC-only share kept as a soft area; missing main-bulk days gap the line rather than plot zero |
| Water — Satellite View | `/water` (Satellite View tab) | ✅ Live, added 2026-07-30 | same fetch as Monthly + `water_daily_consumption` (L1 series) | As-built network map over satellite imagery: 13.7 km of extracted COO87 pipework, 119 plot-joined meters, zone loss gauges, daily timeline. The map engine is the field-verified standalone viewer, self-hosted at `public/satellite/` and embedded in a same-origin iframe; `components/water/satellite/satellite-model.ts` projects the SAME `waterMeters` array the Monthly tab renders into the engine's payload (posted via `satviz:data` handshake), so the two views cannot disagree — no figures are baked into the engine. Geometry (pipes/plots/tank) is static as-built survey data and deliberately NOT in Supabase. `proxy.ts` grants `/satellite/*` its own CSP (`frame-ancestors 'self'`, tile hosts, blob workers) — everywhere else keeps `frame-ancestors 'none'`. Latest month renders as month-to-date, labelled. **2026-07-30 (2):** right detail panel is collapsible (collapsed by default, auto-expands when a zone/meter is selected, header mirrors the panel title); zone selection and map-cards are dropdowns; "Zones only" + a selected zone shows only that zone's card; months with no bulk reading show — instead of a computed 0%. **2026-07-30 (3):** Data view selector — Monthly (with a Month dropdown: period total or any single month; every card, tree row, plate, gauge and the topbar move together, nulls stay —) vs Daily (month dropdown + date slider driving the timeline; L1 only, capped at the last day read); camera buttons consolidated into a labelled Camera dropdown + toggle group; zone cards anchored at the zone's supply-side entry (nearest surveyed plot to the NAMA point) instead of the villa-cluster centre. Fixed: `getDailyWaterConsumptionFromSupabase` now paginates past PostgREST's 1,000-row cap — the unfiltered call was silently dropping July's daily series (2,443 rows in table). **2026-07-30 (4):** villa cards no longer fan out into a floating cloud — each card sits directly over its villa or is culled for that zoom (largest consumer first; zooming in reveals the rest, and a culled villa is one plate-hover away); "All" mode zooms the selected zone in closer by default and re-frames on card-mode change; the selected zone's map card collapses to its pill whenever villa cards are on show; collapsing the right panel now re-runs the card layout so cards under it come back. **2026-07-30 (5, owner request):** zone focus dimming — selecting a zone drops every other zone's ground plates, plot fills and floating cards to low opacity (hover restores a dimmed card), so the chosen zone owns the eye; and the expanded zone map-card now carries the full story instead of stopping at the unbilled %: a bulk / individual / loss m³ trio (mirroring the right panel's gauge) plus the account count (L3 + L4 apartments) in the foot. **2026-07-31 — Stage 1 of the owner-approved redesign (foundation only):** design tokens in the engine (`--s-*` 8px spacing scale, `--r-panel:16px`/`--r-card:12px`/`--r-ctl:8px`, `--ctl-h:44px`, three-level type scale), ONE panel style (96% solid, 16px radius — `#viewctl` and `#hint` now carry `.panel`), ONE uppercase label style (shared selector list; per-rule variants deleted), ONE selected/hover state (`--sel-bg`/`--hov-bg`), serif display face (Roboto Slab) fully retired — Inter everywhere, panels on 16px offsets and 280/320px widths, all controls 44px, chips 32px. Zero logic changes: verified in headless Chromium (boot, zone select + focus dimming, card trio, daily slider/timeline — all intact, zero JS errors). **Stage 2 (2026-07-31, awaiting owner review before merge):** ONE visible period selector — the left panel's Month control; the zone panel's period-chip row and the timeline's month chips are removed (`zonePeriod` and `monthIdx` follow the left selectors, all calculations unchanged); Camera + Map cards moved into one collapsed "View & camera" popover bottom-left (all controls keep their IDs/bindings — pure re-parenting + a show/hide toggle); the bottom bar is Daily-only now (`#tl[hidden]{display:none}` — the author `display:flex` had been defeating the `hidden` attribute); default map-card density is Zones-only (Top 10/All are one popover click away). **Stage 3 (2026-07-31, awaiting owner review before merge):** overlay density — the selected zone's map card auto-expands ONLY while the right panel is collapsed (open panel already tells the story; panel toggle re-renders cards; the caret still overrides); right-panel hierarchy reordered to title → period → loss gauge → bulk/individual/loss trio → explainer → month table → trend → guidance, with the bulk-meter account + position tag demoted to tertiary meta at the bottom; responsive — ≤860px the left panel folds behind a "Filters" button instead of the old `display:none` (which silently removed search/period/zone from tablets), ≤640px the right panel becomes a full-width bottom sheet (60% max-height). Verified at 1600/800/600px: zero page errors, list-driven zone selection works on tablet, all calculations untouched. **2026-08-04 (2):** network.js re-extracted with DWG CURVES TESSELLATED — the first extraction read polyline vertices only, so every bulged road bend collapsed to its chord and the main sliced over buildings (reported on Zone 3B; a 192 m chord is now a 49-vertex curve). `dwg_extract.py` (Water Network Viz `_build/`) flattens bulges/arcs/splines via ezdxf paths at 15 cm sagitta; 423 features, 1,238 base vertices, 13.81 km; needs LibreDWG ≥ 0.14 from git (brew 0.13.3 cannot decode the sheets). Reconciled with the 04-Aug owner-marked road corrections: each mark measured against the curve-true geometry — both Zone 5 marks retired (1.0 m / 4.5 m from the DWG curve, same corridor), Zone 3 (23.6 m) and both Zone 8 corridors (~11 m) KEPT as owner field knowledge beyond the drawing. `network-road-corrections.js` now matches runs by bore/material/junction endpoints (never vertex count) and splices marks between nearest surviving vertices, so re-extractions can't silently no-op it. **2026-08-04 (3, QC audit):** the Zone 3 owner mark itself was the remaining defect — a footprint-intersection audit (96 mains × 271 building polygons, 0.25 m sampling) showed the digitised mark ran 39.5 m + 32.3 m THROUGH two Zone 3B buildings the surveyed curve clears by 4–10 m (independently confirmed against the master as-built DXF: mark crosses wall linework 158×, curve 0×). Mark RETIRED — Zone 3 rides the 49-vertex surveyed curve; only the two Zone 8 corridors keep owner splices (they cross nothing). Final audit: ZERO mains-through-buildings ≥ 1.5 m site-wide (worst residual contact 1.25 m, below tolerance). Effective network 1,252 vertices, `roadAlignedFeatures` 2; corrections cache-buster bumped to v=3 (deployed v=2 still carried the bad splice). Latent note: four 2-vertex stub twins sit within the 1.5 m matcher tolerance — documented in the file, no live target touches them. **2026-08-04 (4, owner request):** building-footprint overlay — the 251 as-built building outlines (true rings where drawn, oriented rectangles labelled indicative elsewhere) now render as a quiet white outline layer beneath the network (`data/building-footprints.js`, UTM→WGS84 via the same EPSG transform as the pipes; rebuild via `_build/footprints_to_wgs.py` in the Water Network Viz folder). Zoom-gated (fades in ≥ z15), "Buildings" toggle in View & camera, legend entry; drawn first so pipes/plates/cards always stack above. Verified: independent pyproj recompute max deviation 0.074 m (rounding only), 279 tests incl. 3 new data-integrity tests, adversarial integration review clean. **2026-08-04 (5, owner request — Village Square):** sub-connections to villas/buildings now render in their own colour in every zone — gold #E8C064 core over a dark casing (hydrant/washout/valve legs moved to soft red #D67A7A matching hydrant points; teal stays reserved for Zone FM + approved as-built overlays), legend updated. Village Square zone panel now carries the building-connection schedule transcribed from the OSCO as-built set AB-MB-VS-0173-PL-WS-001/002 + WSS-003 Rev C (MWMC-01 110Ø main meter chamber, per-shop meters with locations, VCWM-01…04, VC-01…08, 110Ø DCWS HDPE roof-tank filling line) — listed, not drawn: a full georeferencing attempt (DWGs converted via LibreDWG-git, PW-01/02/03 grid-georeferenced with passing scale checks, curve/context ICP fits) established the OSCO sheets carry NO geographic control (local Revit frames, unbound architecture xrefs, raster-only plots) and the 2018 COO87 survey predates the crescent, so no shared geometry exists to fit against — publishing a guessed transform would violate the never-fabricate rule. The surveyed 225 HDPE trunk + FM Road 3/2A junction fronting the crescent are already drawn from COO87 (trunk-to-cabinet tapping not surveyed); overview + zone notes updated with the verified state and the unlock path (field-GPS MWMC-01 cover, VC-01, one hose bib → similarity fit with reported residuals). Full search documented in `public/satellite/INTEGRATION.md`. |
| Electricity | `/electricity` | ✅ Live, inspection-first redesign 2026-07-05 | `electricity_meters` / `electricity_readings` | Two tabs (down from three): **Load Watch** (default) — category (meter_type) severity cards worst-first, category×month load heatmap, auto Exceptions & Actions register (per-meter spike/dip/zero/negative/missing vs each meter's own baseline), with KPIs + trend charts kept below; **Meters & Data** (Analysis + Database in one tab). **2026-07-06:** de-duplicated after review — the two near-identical horizontal bar charts (top-10 consumers + meter-vs-average) collapsed into one **Meters by Consumption** chart (ranked high→low, each bar colored above/below the group average with an "Avg" reference line, the filter-selected meter outlined); the two overlapping consumption tables (Monthly Breakdown + the separate anomaly grid) collapsed into one **Meter Consumption & Anomalies** table that follows the shared date range and keeps search + type filter + rows pagination + CSV, now with a Cost column, a Total row and the anomaly tinting on each cell. Monthly readings through Jun-26 (loaded via hand-run `sql/migrations/update_electricity_*.sql`) **2026-08-31:** KPI tiles swapped from `StatsGrid` to the Water tile (`HierarchyStatGrid`, promoted out of `components/water/daily-report/inline-shared.tsx` into `components/shared/hierarchy-stat-card.tsx`) — same `StatItem[]`, same column counts, so the swap is one line and nothing reflows. The tile is quieter by design (no trend arrow or status word) because Load Watch carries that detail beneath it; `StatsGrid` stays where the trend is the message |
| STP Plant | `/stp` | ✅ Live, inspection-first redesign 2026-07-05 | `stp_operations` | Two tabs: **Plant Watch** (default) — process-health cards worst-first (efficiency, hydraulic load, TSE reuse, tankers, data completeness), load-vs-recovery chart, metric×day heatmap, auto Exceptions & Actions register (data-relative severity + efficiency bands); **Operations & Trends** keeps the KPIs, charts, daily log/CSV and folds the Airtable DB into a collapsible. Daily ops through May-26; 3D plant twin exists only on unmerged PR #21. `stp_operations` added to the `supabase_realtime` publication 2026-07-06, so both this page and the dashboard now refresh live on data changes (the page already subscribed but the table was unpublished) **2026-08-31:** Load vs Recovery rebuilt as an interactive area chart — two layered gradient bands (inlet, TSE) on a single m³ axis plus a 90/30/7-day window selector, replacing the bars-plus-efficiency-line pair on two axes. The bands are layered, not stacked: TSE is the portion of the inlet that came back out, so it sits inside the inlet band and the gap between them is the unrecovered water. Efficiency moved to the tooltip label (it keeps its own process-health tile) — a percentage never shared a scale with m³. TSE stays raw, so a negative reading dips below the axis and a TSE band above the inlet band shows >100% recovery, a physical impossibility the paired axes used to hide. KPI tiles swapped from `StatsGrid` to the Water tile (`HierarchyStatGrid`) so water, electricity and STP present headline figures identically |
| Assets | `/assets` | ✅ Live | `master_assets_register` | 6-card KPI grid; register table with toolbar (PR #25). **2026-07-10:** first load no longer flashes a false "Demo Data / OFFLINE / all-zero KPIs" state — the status bar shows a neutral "Connecting…" chip and the KPI grid stays skeletoned until the first fetch resolves (`PageStatusBar` gained a `loading` prop); realtime changes refresh the table silently instead of blanking it |
| Contractors | `/contractors` | ✅ Live | **`amc_register`** (AMC tab, renewals, alerts), `contractor_contracts` (Contracts tab + header KPIs — still legacy) | AMC tracking, yearly costs. **2026-07-10:** contractor names wrap to two lines with the full name on hover instead of truncating with no affordance (mobile cards wrap fully — touch has no hover). **2026-07-23:** AMC Tracker tab gained the missing database (CSV) export — all three contractor tabs now export. **2026-08-04:** repointed off `Contractor_Tracker` to the new `amc_register` (ACT-012) — see "AMC register cutover" below |
| HVAC | `/hvac` | ✅ Live | Gulf Expert tables | Findings/maintenance model — the layout template other modules align to |
| Fire Safety | `/firefighting` | ✅ Live (redesigned 2026-06-30) | `fire_safety_equipment`, `fire_ppm_activities`, `fire_issues_register`, `fire_ppm_contacts` | BEC AMC: 3 PPM cycles × 4 zones; aligned with HVAC layout (PRs #26/#27) |
| Pest Control | `/pest-control` | ✅ Live | pest tables | **2026-07-10:** the AITable embed (cross-origin iframe — internals can't be restyled) now follows the app's light/dark theme via its `theme` param, sits behind a card-surface loading cover until it finishes loading, and gains an "Open full view" header action |
| Firefighting quotes, settings, auth pages | various | ✅ Live | | |

**2026-07-10 — cross-module UX/perf pass** (applies to Dashboard, Water,
Electricity, STP, Contractors, HVAC, Fire Safety, Assets):

- **Instant module switching.** All module pages fetch client-side on mount;
  previously nothing was cached, so every sidebar navigation — including
  returning to a module visited seconds earlier — replaced the page with its
  full skeleton until the fetch resolved (felt like a full reload; links were
  already `next/link`). New `lib/page-cache.ts` (session-scoped
  stale-while-revalidate Map) seeds each page's state on revisit and the mount
  fetch refreshes silently in place. First-ever visits keep the one-time
  skeleton; the brand splash remains initial-app-load only. Sidebar + bottom-nav
  icons swap to a spinner while their navigation is in flight (`useLinkStatus`).
- **Toasts moved top-right** (below the topbar, aria-live, click-through
  wrapper) — they previously sat bottom-right where they covered the last KPI
  card (seen on `/stp` with "STP: High Tanker Activity").
- **KPI labels wrap instead of truncating mid-word** on narrow viewports
  ("WATER PRODUCTI…") — command deck + shared `StatsGrid`.

**2026-07-13 — alert reliability + interface consistency pass** (cross-module):

- **Data-driven operational alerts.** New pure rules engine
  `lib/operational-alerts.ts` (unit-tested) evaluates live data for the three
  operational risk classes and is the single source of truth for "is anything
  wrong": water system loss vs the 15% target (critical zones >25% listed;
  months without an A1/NAMA reading are skipped, never reported as fake loss),
  contract expiry from `amc_register` (past End Date while still marked
  Active = critical; within 60 days = warning; rows already marked Expired are
  treated as closed history), and STP critical failures (zero TSE output while
  sewage arrived, recovery under the 90/80% bands, daily log stale >3 days).
  `hooks/useOperationalAlerts.ts` fetches sources, re-evaluates on realtime
  changes + a 30-min clock tick, persists acknowledgements per condition
  fingerprint (localStorage; a new month/day/set re-raises), and fires ONE
  browser push per new warning/critical fingerprint. **Mock data is never
  evaluated** — when live sources are unreachable the feed says monitoring is
  offline/partial instead of pretending health. This closes the core alert
  bug: the app could show "all caught up" while the Water page flagged losses
  28.8 pp above target in red.
- **Alert surfaces.** Shared feed component (`components/alerts/alerts-feed.tsx`)
  renders active alerts (severity icon + module chip + Review link +
  Acknowledge/Reopen) above session notifications, with honest empty/degraded
  states. The mobile Alerts sheet now uses it, and a **new topbar bell**
  (`components/layout/notification-bell.tsx`) gives desktop its first alert
  surface (badge = unacked alerts + unseen session notifications; opening the
  feed marks session items read). Dashboard "Latest Updates" now leads with
  live alerts, so its previously-dead **critical** filter works.
- **Monthly-change calculation standardised.** One shared `lib/trends.ts`
  (`calcTrend`/`describeTrend`) replaced three divergent copies (dashboard
  hook, Electricity page, STP page) that disagreed on neutral labels
  ('0%' vs '—' vs '~0%'); no-baseline (`—`) is now distinguished from
  stable (`~0%`) everywhere, including the dashboard chart insight lines.
- **Dashboard chart time axes aligned.** Both hero charts plot one shared,
  calendar-contiguous last-8-months window (ending at the newest month across
  water + STP); months without a reading render as gaps instead of being
  silently dropped (the missing Jun-26 NAMA month now shows as a gap), and the
  water running-average ignores gap months. KPI subtitles standardised to the
  app-wide `Mon-YY` month format (STP previously showed "Mon YY").
- **Colour usage unified.** `lib/water-monthly-data.ts` was the last rogue
  hex palette: `sev()`/`statusFromLoss()` now resolve the same `--mb-*` status
  tokens as the shared inspection toolkit (plus a `chart` mid-tone for
  bar/border fills), and `TYPECOL` maps to `--chart-*` tokens — Water Monthly
  severity visuals now match STP Plant Watch / Electricity Load Watch and
  theme correctly in light/dark.
- **Settings corrected.** Profile card no longer claims information is
  "public"; the Account tab's stray Save button (it saved *profile* fields) was
  removed; the Notifications tab dropped the fictional email-digest and SMS
  toggles and now shows the real monitored conditions plus a working,
  persisted browser-push preference (`lib/alert-preferences.ts`) and the
  actual browser permission state with an Enable action.

**2026-07-11 — mobile bottom navigation redesign.** The mobile dock
(`components/layout/bottom-nav.tsx`) was rebuilt from the 5-modules-plus-"More"
bar into a floating, rounded **pill** with four tabs — **Overview** (dashboard
link), **Modules**, **Alerts** and **Profile**. Modules/Alerts/Profile open
slide-up sheets rather than navigating: Modules is a 2-column grid of every
operations module (RBAC-filtered, module-accent icons); Alerts renders the
in-app notification feed from `useAppNotifications` with a red unread-count
badge on the bell (plus push-enable prompt + "all caught up" empty state);
Profile carries the account card, a light/dark appearance toggle, Settings and
Sign Out. Because the sidebar is unreachable on phones, these sheets deliberately
expose everything the desktop sidebar does. Theme-aware and token-only (dark
elevated pill / light card pill, teal `--secondary` active state) with
focus-trap + Escape + background-scroll-lock on the sheets. Page bottom padding
(`client-layout.tsx`) was raised to clear the taller floating dock, and the
print stylesheet's stale `nav[aria-label="Primary navigation"]` selector was
corrected to `"Mobile navigation"` so the dock is hidden when printing.

**2026-07-23 — database export everywhere (cross-module).** Every data
table/register in the app now has a CSV download. A new shared
`ExportButton` (`components/shared/data-table/export-button.tsx`, exported
from the data-table index) standardises the button: exports the *filtered*
rows with the full column set of the underlying table, date-stamped
filename, disabled state when empty, row-count hover title. Added where
export was missing: **Contractors → AMC Tracker** (the `Contractor_Tracker`
table itself — Contracts and Yearly Costs already exported), **HVAC →
Maintenance** (`ge_ppm_findings`, 16 columns incl. action required /
contractor notes / recurring flags) and **Recurring Issues**
(`ge_recurring_issues`, via a new count-plus-export header), **Fire Safety
→ Equipment Register, Issues & Defects Register** (export action on the
section headings) **and the Maintenance PPM table** (toolbar button,
cycle/zone/status exported as readable labels), and the **Water Monthly
zone drill-downs** (A1 Reconciliation + Individual Meters panels — compact
CSV button beside the rows picker, using the dashboard's own
`downloadRows`). `lib/export-utils.ts` CSV downloads are now UTF-8
BOM-prefixed so Excel renders Arabic names and symbols correctly (benefits
all pre-existing exports), arrays export joined with `;`, and an explicit
column spec now yields a header-only file instead of an empty one when a
table has no rows. Pre-existing exports (water database tables,
electricity, STP daily log, assets, exceptions registers) are unchanged;
unit tests cover the CSV builder and the shared button (203 tests green).

**2026-07-25 — front-end & O&M evaluation + remediation wave** (cross-module,
PR #49). A full senior-management review of every route and subsection was run
against the codebase; the findings and the fixes below are the result.

*Scope decision from management:* the app **identifies** issues; it does not
track their resolution. Work orders, task assignment, owners, due dates,
status transitions and close-out evidence are **explicitly out of scope** —
issues are actioned on the floor. Accordingly the fake `Owner` /
`Status: "Open"` columns were **removed** from every exceptions register
(they implied a workflow that does not and will not exist). The registers are
now identification-only: severity, item, value, remarks, suggested action.

- **Fabricated data removed (P0).** `app/login/page.tsx` rendered a "Live
  System Status" panel with hardcoded figures (2,847 m³ water, 148 kWh,
  892 m³ TSE) and pulsing Normal/Nominal/Active pills, above a comment
  claiming it showed real system data — on a pre-auth page that cannot read
  any data. Replaced with a capability list carrying no figures.
- **Silent mock data removed (P0).** `/water` swapped in `MOCK_WATER_METERS`
  on a failed *or empty* fetch and rendered it as an ordinary dashboard.
  Nothing is substituted for live data now — `WaterErrorState` /
  `WaterEmptyState` say what happened and offer a retry.
- **Error boundaries were shipped but never mounted (P0).** Two
  implementations (`components/shared/error-boundary.tsx`,
  `components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`, ~212 LOC) had zero consumers, so any
  render fault blanked the whole route. Consolidated into
  `components/shared/section-boundary.tsx` and wrapped around every major
  section app-wide.
- **Wrong numbers corrected.** Assets "WITH AMC CONTRACTOR" was rendering a
  count of `is_asset_active`, and "HIGH CRITICALITY" a 3-way OR
  (`erl_years≤2 OR criticality=High OR status=TO VERIFY`); both now query what
  they claim. Warranty Expiry sort had no entry in `SORT_FIELD_MAP` and
  silently sorted by name. The row-count footer claimed "1–3061 of 3061"
  while fetching 500.
- **HVAC was showing an expired contract as current** — OMR 8,557.5 hardcoded
  in `overview-tab.tsx`, which `gulf_expert_contracts` marks EXPIRED; the live
  2026-27 contract is **OMR 7,234.000**. Now data-driven. HVAC also queried
  with no `.range()` and hit PostgREST's 1,000-row default silently; reads are
  paged and truncation is now surfaced.
- **Thresholds unified.** New `lib/thresholds.ts` is the single source for
  Electricity and STP. Previously four competing sets meant one meter could
  read Critical on Load Watch and merely High in the table below it. Active
  gate values are printed in the UI instead of hardcoded prose.
- **Data honesty.** Missing / zero / negative readings are three distinct
  states everywhere (electricity table + CSV preserve NULL-vs-0); negative TSE
  raises its own data-integrity finding instead of being masked as "reuse
  stopped"; STP silently-dropped future-dated rows are now reported; the three
  hand-rolled STP SVG charts became Recharts with tooltips and real axes, and
  the silent every-Nth sampling that could hide a one-day spike was removed.
- **Personal data removed.** `app/firefighting/page.tsx` contained two private
  Gmail addresses and named individuals for tanker agreements, committed in
  source. Removed. The PPM plan, contract, SLA and insurance blocks were moved
  out of component source into `ppm-programme.ts` / `contract-reference.ts`,
  each stamped "Contract reference · as of <date>" so static paperwork cannot
  read as a live reading.
- **Dormant functionality wired up.** `getContractorExpiry` /
  `getContractorDetails` / `getContractorPricing` were built, exported and
  called by no page. Contractors now has Renewals and Terms & SLA tabs; end
  dates are parsed (13 real-world formats) and given severity instead of being
  printed verbatim, so an expiring contract can finally be seen.
- **Dead code deleted (~4,300 LOC).** Nine unreferenced Water components plus
  an entire parallel daily implementation (`zone-panel`, `dc-panel`,
  `report-primitives`, `report-types`, `zone-analytics`), the duplicate error
  boundary, and the unused `hooks/useSTPData.ts`.
- **Accessibility & consistency.** `TableHead` defaults `scope="col"` (fixes 12
  consumers); status is never colour-only; 44px minimum touch targets on coarse
  pointers; remaining hex literals replaced with tokens; Fire/HVAC registers
  rebuilt on the shared table primitives; `RouteRoleGuard` finally wires
  `RequireRole`, which had been written but never imported (route gating was
  dead code — only nav links were hidden).
- **Chart motion now honours `prefers-reduced-motion` (2026-07-25).** Every
  other animated surface already checked the setting; Recharts did not. Recharts
  defaults `isAnimationActive` to `true` and offers no global switch, so all
  **49 series across 13 files** animated regardless of the user's OS preference
  — the single largest reduced-motion gap in the app. New reactive hook
  `hooks/useReducedMotion.ts` (`useReducedMotion` + `useChartMotion`) is now
  spread onto every series. It is built on `useSyncExternalStore`, so it also
  responds to the setting being toggled *mid-session*, which the existing
  one-shot `lib/motion.ts#prefersReducedMotion()` cannot do (that function is
  for calling inside a GSAP effect, not during render — both are correct, they
  serve different call sites). Chart duration also moved off Recharts' stock
  1500ms onto the shared `MOTION.dur.count`, so a chart and the KPI roll-up
  above it settle together. A duplicate one-shot `matchMedia` read in
  `liquid-bar-chart.tsx` was removed in favour of the hook.
- **KPI figures mark themselves when they change (2026-07-26).** The dashboard
  refreshes from Supabase realtime *in place*, so a reading could move under an
  operator with nothing to say it had — on a wall-mounted or glanced-at screen
  that is the difference between noticing a change and missing it. New hook
  `hooks/useValueChanged.ts`, wired into the KPI tiles: when a figure actually
  moves, its tile carries one sweep of the accent and the number lifts to the
  info colour, settling back over 1.4s. Three rules keep it from becoming
  noise: it **never fires on first render** (`previous` is seeded with the
  initial value, so a figure appearing is not a figure changing — flashing
  every tile on load would train people to ignore the signal); the comparison
  runs **during render**, React's documented "adjust state when a prop changes"
  pattern, so it costs no second render pass and does not trip
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`; and it stays **silent under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`**, because the highlight only ever reinforces the
  change — the figure updates either way. `StatsGrid`'s tile is now a separate
  `StatTile` component, since the hook has to run per tile.
- **Dashboard for management.** Acknowledged alerts no longer persist; each
  severity has a distinct icon + text label; KPI period labels are always
  visible (they were suppressed whenever a trend existed, i.e. always) and the
  differing "latest month" rules are disclosed; targets, YTD and a labelled
  straight-line projection added; the five modules with no executive visibility
  (Assets, Contractors, HVAC, Fire, Pest) now appear via `useModuleCoverage`.
- **PWA / App Store groundwork.** Complete manifest, generated icon set,
  offline shell, service worker v7. Note a PWA **cannot** be listed on the App
  Store — see the `mobile/` Expo app below.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors · ESLint clean · 203/203 tests ·
`next build` succeeds (21 routes).

**2026-08-24 — unified table conformance pass (cross-module).** Every data
table was audited against the STP Daily Operations Log reference (the approved
unified-table look: brand-purple sticky header with sort arrows, toolbar with
title/search/filter/Export CSV/record count, zebra rows, emphasized first
column, pagination, mobile handling) and the gaps were closed. No new
dependencies — everything reuses `components/shared/data-table/` and
`components/ui/table`.

- **First-column emphasis is now a system default.** `.ops-table tbody
  td:first-child` renders at weight 600 (base cells 500) via `globals.css`,
  with a `data-plain-first-col` opt-out on `<Table>`. The base cell weight
  moved off `<TableCell>`'s Tailwind class into the `.ops-table` rule so the
  components-layer emphasis can win; per-cell weight utilities still override.
  Redundant per-file `font-medium` first cells were dropped (fire equipment /
  issues registers, HVAC PPM schedule).
- **`components/shared/findings-register.tsx` rebuilt on the unified
  primitives** (affects STP Plant Watch + Electricity Load Watch registers):
  raw `<table>` → `<Table>` (fixes the non-sticky header inside its scroll
  box), new column sorting, `TablePagination` (25/50/100/All) replacing the
  "show 50 more" batching, `ExportButton`, a `md:hidden` card list (it had no
  mobile variant), and the toolbar layout of the reference. Props API
  unchanged; still identification-only.
- **Sorting added** where header sorting was missing: STP Process health
  (status + summary), Electricity meters table Total (kWh) + Cost (OMR)
  columns, Contractors renewals (5 columns) and AMC pricing (contractor,
  total).
- **CSV export added** where absent: STP Process health, Electricity Category
  performance, Water Zone performance (Daily → Zone Watch), Water DC daily
  matrix, Water zone L3 day matrix (all via `ExportButton`, filtered rows,
  nulls exported empty — never 0), and the Water Monthly Buildings
  bulk-vs-apartments panel (compact `PanelExport`, matching its siblings).
  Bespoke export buttons on Contractors → Contracts, Assets (all five tabs,
  now per-tab column specs) and the Water daily database swapped to the shared
  `ExportButton`.
- **Raw-table migrations:** Contractors yearly cost matrix →
  `<Table>`/`TableFooter` (was a hand-classed `ops-table`), Water daily
  Exceptions & Actions → `<Table>` primitives.
- **Toolbar titles/subtitles** added inside `TableToolbar` (matching the
  reference) on: Electricity meters, HVAC PPM Findings + Recurring Issues,
  Fire PPM Maintenance Tracker, Contractors Contracts/Yearly/AMC Tracker,
  Contractors renewals/pricing/terms, Assets (tab-aware).
- **Deliberately exempt** (visualization matrices, not data tables):
  `MetricHeatmap` (`shared/inspection.tsx`), the zone×day heatmap in
  `zone-watch.tsx`, and the zone-loss heatmap in the water monthly dashboard.
  The water monthly dashboard's remaining bespoke tables (A1 reconciliation,
  zone meters, meter database, exceptions register) already wear the reference
  look — the CSS was originally modelled on them — and keep their internals;
  migrating them onto the primitives stays on the known-gaps list (§4).

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors · ESLint clean · 284/284 tests ·
`next build` succeeds (21 routes) · headless-Chromium pass over STP,
Electricity, Contractors, Fire, Assets in mock/offline mode — zero console
errors, first-column weight 600 confirmed computed.

## 3. Water monthly data — how it works now (important)

Rebuilt 2026-07-03 (PRs #29/#30) so that **any monthly value present in the
backend appears in the frontend automatically** — the recurring "dashboard
stops at last month" problem is structurally closed:

- The app reads long-format tables: `water_meters` (registry, 350 meters,
  `meter_id` like `MB-L2-001`) + `water_monthly_consumption`
  (`meter_id, period 'YYYY-MM', consumption`). No month list is hardcoded
  anywhere in the app; no fetch ceiling (device-clock independent).
- The legacy wide sheet **"Water System" is a writable VIEW**: INSERT/UPDATE
  against it (Supabase Studio edits, old Airtable sync scripts,
  `scripts/update-water-data.ts`) fire an INSTEAD OF trigger
  (`water_system_view_write`) that upserts the base tables — auto-registering
  brand-new meters and translating legacy zone/type spellings to clean codes.
- The view **rebuilds itself monthly** (pg_cron job `water-system-view-rebuild`,
  00:10 UTC on the 1st) via `rebuild_water_system_view()`, extending its month
  columns one year past the newest data — new years need no schema work.
- `water_meters` + `water_monthly_consumption` are in the `supabase_realtime`
  publication; the Water page and dashboard hook subscribe to them, so open
  dashboards refresh live when data lands.
- Migration source of truth: `muscatbay/app/sql/migrations/20260703_water_monthly_auto_sync.sql`
  (applied to the live DB as `water_monthly_auto_sync` + `_hardening`).
- Daily data path (unchanged): CSV/Grafana → `water_daily_consumption`
  (GitHub-Actions Grafana sync exists on unmerged PR #6 only).
- **Current-month fallback (added 2026-07-29):** the official monthly reads for
  a month are imported a few days into the NEXT month (June-26's rows were
  created 3–4 July), so the in-progress month used to be invisible in the
  Monthly view (owner report: "July doesn't appear"). `fetchWaterMeters` now
  detects months present in `water_daily_consumption` but absent from
  `water_monthly_consumption` (PostgREST `not in` on the covered month keys),
  sums the real daily readings per meter (nulls skipped — an unread meter
  stays `null`, never 0; negatives kept and flagged), and merges them in as
  **month-to-date** values. It reports them as `derivedMonths`
  (`{ month, throughDay }`) and the dashboard shows a labelled info note
  ("July 2026 is month-to-date — summed from daily readings through day N;
  official monthly readings will replace these figures automatically"). By
  construction the merge never overwrites an official monthly value, and the
  month leaves the fallback on the first fetch after the import lands. The
  Water page also subscribes to `water_daily_consumption` realtime now, so the
  month-to-date figures freshen as daily data arrives. Note for testers: daily
  sums ≠ official monthly reads (June-26: 317/350 meters differ, avg ~56 m³),
  which is exactly why these months carry the provenance label.

## 4. Known gaps & data debt

- **Google sign-in ships dark until its provider is enabled in Supabase
  (2026-08-28).** `/login` and `/signup` now carry a "Continue with Google"
  button (`components/auth/google-sign-in-button.tsx` →
  `signInWithGoogle()` in `lib/auth.ts` → Supabase OAuth → the existing PKCE
  exchange in `/auth/callback`, which gained an `oauth` flow variant with
  Google-specific copy and an in-place retry). One flow covers sign-in AND
  first-time sign-up: Google has already verified the address, so new users
  skip the confirmation-email round-trip, and the DB-side
  `on_auth_user_created` trigger creates their `profiles` row (default role
  `user`, Google name/avatar from `raw_user_meta_data`) exactly as for email
  signups — no schema change needed. The code path is live but INERT until a
  one-time dashboard setup: (1) Google Cloud Console → create an OAuth 2.0
  Web client with authorised redirect URI
  `https://utnlgeuqajmwibqmdmgt.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`; (2) Supabase →
  Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Google → enable and paste the client
  ID + secret; (3) Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → confirm
  `https://muscatbay.work/auth/callback` (plus www/vercel aliases) sits in
  the redirect allow-list (the email flows already use this URL). Until then
  the button surfaces Supabase's "provider is not enabled" error, mapped to a
  friendly "Google sign-in isn't switched on for this app yet" message —
  nothing breaks, nothing is faked.
  **Update 2026-08-28 (later):** the owner created the Google OAuth client
  (project `muscat-bay-410005`, verified remotely: Google serves the sign-in
  page for it with the Supabase callback) and enabled the provider in
  Supabase — Google sign-in works on the PR preview. ONE step remains: the
  Google consent screen is still in **Testing** (only listed test users can
  sign in) until the owner publishes it, which needs the app's public URLs —
  home `https://muscatbay.work`, privacy `https://muscatbay.work/privacy`,
  terms `https://muscatbay.work/terms`. To make those last two genuinely
  public, `/privacy` and `/terms` were added to the auth provider's
  `PUBLIC_ROUTES` (they were login-gated — a signed-out visitor, including
  anyone checking the consent-screen links, bounced to `/login`) and to a new
  `OPEN_WHEN_AUTHENTICATED` list so signed-in users can read them too
  instead of being bounced to `/`. The OAuth callback is built from
  `window.location.origin` (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`): the PKCE verifier
  is host-scoped, so the round-trip must stay on the origin that started it
  — meaning every origin that should offer Google sign-in (canonical, www,
  vercel alias, previews) must be in Supabase's redirect allow-list.
  **Update 2026-08-28 (later still): the double-redemption bug is fixed.**
  With the provider live and the host canonicalised, sign-in still ended on
  "Google sign-in didn't work" every time — and the session had in fact
  been created. Two things redeemed the single-use PKCE code: GoTrue does
  it itself from its own constructor (`detectSessionInUrl` is on, and the
  browser client is built during the `/auth/callback` page load, while the
  code is still in the URL), saving the session and DELETING the code
  verifier; `/auth/callback`'s own `exchangeCodeForSession()` awaits that
  same initialisation, so it always ran second, found no verifier, and
  failed with "PKCE code verifier not found in storage" → the OAuth error
  card. The flag **cannot** be turned off from app code: `@supabase/ssr`'s
  `createBrowserClient` spreads `options.auth` first and then hardcodes
  `detectSessionInUrl`, so passing it is silently discarded. So
  on a failed PKCE exchange `/auth/callback` now forgives it **only
  when both** are true: the error says the verifier was already spent
  (`/code.verifier|flow.state/i`) **and** `getSession()` returns a live
  session. Together those mean something else completed that exact
  exchange. Any other failure still reports. Deliberately narrow — an
  earlier cut forgave *any* failed exchange whenever a session existed
  and also covered the `token_hash` email flows, which would have
  silently carried a signed-in user on from a genuinely expired link
  instead of telling them it expired. `detectSessionInUrl` never
  inspects `token_hash` (only the implicit hash and PKCE `?code=`), so
  there was no race to tolerate there; that branch reports as before.
  A `handledRef` guard runs the handler once per mount, so a re-run
  effect cannot re-spend a single-use credential. Two test layers:
  `__tests__/pages/auth-callback.test.tsx` covers the page's logic
  (with the auth client stubbed), and
  `__tests__/functions/pkce-double-redemption.test.ts` pins the *library*
  behaviour that logic exists to survive — it drives the real
  `@supabase/ssr` + `@supabase/auth-js` with only the network mocked, so a
  dependency bump that changes any of this fails there instead of
  silently breaking sign-in in production again.

- **`?next=` on /auth/callback was an open redirect, now closed
  (2026-08-28).** The post-auth destination was read straight from the
  query string and handed to `router.push()`, so
  `/auth/callback?next=https://evil.com` bounced a user off this origin
  at the moment they had just authenticated — a phishing hand-off out
  of the app's own sign-in, and the same hole pointed inward with a
  `javascript:` value. Pre-existing, found by a review bot on #71.
  `safeNext()` in `lib/validation.ts` now reduces the value to an
  internal path or `/`, rejecting any scheme, protocol-relative `//`
  or `/\`, and anything not rooted; `/auth/callback` sanitises once at
  the single point it reads the param, so all five `router.push(next)`
  sites are covered. A rejected value is not an error screen — sign-in
  did succeed, so it lands on the dashboard rather than stranding the
  user on a failure card over a destination they never chose. Tests:
  `__tests__/lib/auth-next-redirect.test.ts`.

- **Water monthly dashboard tables still bespoke (2026-08-24).** The A1
  reconciliation, per-zone meters, meter database and exceptions register in
  `components/water/monthly/water-monthly-dashboard.tsx` render raw `<table>`
  markup with inline token styles that *visually* match the unified table
  system (the `.ops-table` CSS was modelled on them) but bypass the `<Table>`
  primitives, use the `RowsPicker` truncation instead of `TablePagination`,
  have no column sorting, and export via `downloadRows` rather than
  `ExportButton`. Same for the `inline-shared.tsx` mini-library (its `Th` /
  `TableSearch` / `TablePagination` shadow the shared ones) used by the daily
  DC/L3 matrices. Functional gaps were closed in the 2026-08-24 pass (all now
  export; heavy tables keep their caps); the structural migration is deferred
  — it is a large, behavior-sensitive refactor of the app's most bespoke
  module.

- **Ticker always scrolls + STP down to four cards — 2026-07-29 (owner follow-up).**
  - **The "static when everything fits" ticker rule is retired.** The
    2026-07-26 jam fix held the strip still whenever one run was narrower than
    the viewport — geometrically correct, but the owner's verdict is that a
    news band should always be moving. `useTickerLoop` now satisfies the same
    seamlessness constraint the way a news channel does: the run is
    **repeated** (`repeat = ceil(viewport / run)` copies per half-track, both
    tickers render `2 × repeat` runs) so half the track always covers the
    viewport, and the strip always scrolls at the constant 26 px/s. Duration
    derives from the travelled distance (`repeat × runWidth`). Copies after
    the first are `aria-hidden` (read aloud once); under
    `prefers-reduced-motion` the CSS hides every hidden copy, so the repeat
    never shows duplicated stats — one still, swipeable run. `data-static`
    now means "unmeasured yet" only. Geometry tests updated (6 cases).
  - **STP summary: 5 → 4 cards** (Inlet Sewage, TSE for Irrigation, Tanker
    Trips, Total Economic Impact — one clean 4-across row). Treatment
    Efficiency stopped being a card: it is TSE ÷ inlet, so it now rides on the
    TSE subtitle ("N% of inlet recycled") and remains the LEAD health card on
    the Plant Watch tab with its target bands intact.
  - **Note for testers**: on a device with iOS/macOS "Reduce Motion" enabled
    (as on the iPad in the 2026-07-29 screenshots) the ticker deliberately
    does not auto-scroll — that is the OS accessibility contract, and the
    strip is swipeable instead. Turn off Settings → Accessibility → Motion →
    Reduce Motion to see the marquee.

- **Ticker pace/size + Electricity/STP KPI de-clutter — 2026-07-29 (owner request).**
  - **Ticker**: scroll speed lowered 40 → 26 px/s (`hooks/useTickerLoop.ts` —
    the speed constant is the single source; the pace test derives from it) and
    the band sized up: 34 → 42px min-height, label 10 → 11px, value 12.5 →
    14px, caption 9.5 → 10.5px, icons 14 → 16px. Applies to all four strips
    (Estate briefing, Water Daily briefing, Load briefing, Plant briefing) via
    the shared `mb-ticker-*` classes. Still a single-line news band.
  - **Electricity Load Watch**: the category health grid no longer renders all
    10 meter-type cards (a 2×5 wall). Cards are budgeted for triage: every
    non-healthy category ALWAYS gets its own card (a warning is never folded),
    the biggest quiet categories fill up to 5, and the remaining quiet ones
    collapse into one combined "Other categories (N)" card. Every category
    still has its own row in the heatmap directly below, so nothing is lost.
    Grid is now xl:3-across (wider, calmer cards).
  - **STP summary**: 8 KPI cards → 5. Nothing dropped — three figures stopped
    being headline cards: Daily Average Inlet folded into the Inlet Sewage
    subtitle; Generated Income + Water Savings folded into the Total Economic
    Impact subtitle (the total is their sum — three cards were saying one
    thing). The monthly financial chart still plots income and savings as
    separate series.

- **"Water section crashed" + "ticker ballooned" QA report — diagnosed and fixed 2026-07-29 (second pass).**
  Two screenshots from an operator's iPad, taken minutes after the 01:46 UTC
  production deploy. Neither was what it looked like:
  - **The /water "unexpected error" was the deploy race, not a water bug.** A
    PWA session opened before a deploy still references the old content-hashed
    chunk URLs; the first navigation to a not-yet-visited route requests a
    chunk the new deployment no longer serves → the rejected dynamic import
    lands in `app/error.tsx`. Proven not to be data-driven: both water views
    were rendered in a jsdom harness against the **full live production
    dataset** (350 meters × 30 months monthly; 350 Jul-26 daily rows, all five
    tabs) with zero throws. `sw.js`'s own v5 history note records this exact
    class. Fixes: `app/error.tsx` now detects stale-chunk errors and reloads
    once automatically (sessionStorage guard against loops, re-armed on clean
    boot by `register-sw`); `register-sw.tsx` re-checks for a new SW every
    30 min and on visibilitychange, so long-lived control-room sessions adopt
    new builds before an operator trips on one; both `/water` views are now
    wrapped in `SectionBoundary` so a genuine render fault degrades to a
    section panel instead of blanking the route.
  - **The ticker was the reduced-motion fallback, not a regression of the
    2026-07-26 fix.** That iPad has "Reduce Motion" on. The
    `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS wrapped the stats (`flex-wrap: wrap`),
    ballooning the 34px news band into a 4-row block. Reduced motion now stops
    the *auto*-scroll only: the band keeps its single-line shape and the
    off-screen tail is reachable by swipe (`overflow-x: auto`, scrollbar
    hidden) — a user-initiated gesture is not the motion the OS setting asks
    us to remove.
  - **Perf: `/water` first paint.** `fetchWaterMeters` walked the ~10.5k-row
    consumption table in 11 **sequential** 1000-row pages — ~11 back-to-back
    round-trips to ap-northeast-1 was most of the first-visit delay. It now
    HEAD-counts and fetches all pages in parallel (~2 round-trips total,
    independent of how many months accrue).

- **Mobile "missing sections / crash" incident — diagnosed and fixed 2026-07-29.**
  Reported after a colleague tested the PWA on their phone on 2026-07-28: the
  bottom navigation did not show all sections, some sections would not open, and
  the app "crashed and restarted from the beginning". **None of it was a crash.**
  All three symptoms were one root cause, confirmed against the live database:
  - That colleague's account was created **2026-07-28** and carries the role
    **`viewer`** — which is also the `profiles.role` column default, so it is
    what *every* new sign-up gets. `ROLE_MODULES.viewer` listed only dashboard,
    water, electricity, stp and settings.
  - **Symptom 1** — the Modules sheet in `components/layout/bottom-nav.tsx`
    filters through `canAccessModule`, so it rendered **3 of 8** modules.
    (The dock itself is always 4 fixed tabs: Overview / Modules / Alerts /
    Profile.)
  - **Symptom 2 + 3** — `components/dashboard/module-coverage.tsx` was **not**
    RBAC-filtered. It rendered `<Link>` cards for exactly the five modules a
    viewer cannot open. Tapping one hit `RouteRoleGuard`, which showed a
    "Module not available" panel and then **auto-redirected to `/` after 4 s**.
    Tap a module → it does not render → seconds later you are back at the start
    screen. That is the "crash and restart".

  Fixes, all in the 2026-07-29 change:
  - **`lib/rbac.ts` — every role now sees every module**, per the owner's
    instruction that all users may view all sections. The per-role split is gone
    rather than patched, so a new sign-up needs no manual promotion. The `Role`
    type and the gating machinery stay in place for future use.
  - **`components/dashboard/module-coverage.tsx` now applies the same RBAC
    filter as the sidebar and bottom nav**, so all three navigation surfaces
    agree and the dashboard can never again offer a door the guard slams.
  - **`components/auth/require-role.tsx` no longer auto-redirects.** Navigating
    the user away from a page they asked for, with no input from them, is what
    made a permissions block read as a crash. The panel now explains and offers
    an explicit button.
  - **`__tests__/lib/rbac.test.ts`** (14 tests) locks all of the above in.

- **`AbortSignal.any` was unguarded on older iOS — fixed 2026-07-29.**
  `functions/supabase-client.ts` wrapped every Supabase request in
  `AbortSignal.any([...])`, which landed in **Safari 17.4** (and Chrome 116 /
  Firefox 124). On an older iPhone that threw a `TypeError` inside *every*
  Supabase call, auth included — a whole-app failure that would look exactly
  like "sections don't render on his device but work on mine". `AbortSignal.timeout`
  (Safari 16) had the same exposure. Both are now feature-detected, falling back
  to Supabase's own signal rather than throwing. This was **not** confirmed as a
  cause of the 2026-07-28 report — the RBAC chain above fully explains it — but
  it is a real hazard on any device below those versions.

- **✅ CLOSED 2026-07-29 — Supabase RLS let any signed-in account become an admin.**
  Found 2026-07-29 by reading the **live** state of project
  `utnlgeuqajmwibqmdmgt` (not the migration files — the two disagree).
  `public.profiles` carries the correct anti-self-elevation policy
  (`"Users can update own profile"`, whose `WITH CHECK` pins `role` to its
  current value) **and** a blanket `mb_authenticated_all` (`ALL`, `USING true`,
  `WITH CHECK true`). Postgres **OR**s permissive policies, so the blanket one
  wins outright: any logged-in user can run
  `update profiles set role='admin' where id=auth.uid()` and self-promote — and
  can rewrite every other user's row. That makes `lib/rbac.ts`'s `viewer`
  default and the whole `ROLE_MODULES` gate unenforceable.
  **Applied to the live project on 2026-07-29** (migrations
  `rls_regression_fixes_20260729` + `revoke_secdef_execute_from_public_20260729`).
  Verified afterwards: `mb_authenticated_all` is gone and only the three scoped
  policies remain, so `role` can no longer be self-edited.

- **🟠 OPEN — RBAC is presentation-only.** 68 tables grant `authenticated` a
  blanket `ALL / USING true / WITH CHECK true`. A `viewer` (board-presentation
  profile) or `contractor` account is hidden from modules in the sidebar but can
  still read **and write and delete** every table through the REST API with its
  own session token. Closing this is a real behavioural change (a demoted
  account loses write access), so it is deliberately left out of the
  2026-07-29 migration and sketched at the bottom of that file instead — it
  needs a per-module decision on who may write.

- **✅ CLOSED 2026-07-29 — `water_monthly_consumption_backup_20260727` had RLS disabled.**
  The only table in `public` without RLS, so it is readable *and writable* by
  `anon` — i.e. by anyone holding the public anon key, which ships in the client
  bundle. It carries `account_number`. Created by migration `20260727061805`,
  which post-dates the 2026-07-18 hardening pass and so was missed by it.
  RLS is now enabled with no policy, denying anon and authenticated while
  leaving `service_role` (restore-from-backup) working.

- **✅ CLOSED 2026-07-29 — 13 SECURITY DEFINER functions were callable by `anon`.** Reachable
  unauthenticated at `/rest/v1/rpc/<name>`; the write-capable ones
  (`stp_upsert_operations`, `sync_grafana_water_consumption`,
  `aggregate_daily_to_monthly`, …) let an anonymous caller mutate operational
  data. None is called from the browser.

  **This one bit back and is worth remembering.** The first migration ran
  `revoke execute ... from anon` — a silent no-op. These functions carry the
  default `EXECUTE TO PUBLIC` grant (the `=X/postgres` entry in
  `pg_proc.proacl`), and `anon` inherits through PUBLIC; revoking from a *role*
  never removes what it holds *via PUBLIC*. Post-apply verification caught it —
  `anon` still had all 13 — and a second migration revoking from PUBLIC closed
  it properly. **Verify a REVOKE with `has_function_privilege(...)`; do not
  assume it did anything.** `service_role` (edge functions) and `postgres`
  (all four cron jobs) keep EXECUTE, so automation was never at risk;
  `authenticated` deliberately keeps it too, since the exposure was
  unauthenticated reach.

- **🔵 OPEN — dashboard-only auth settings.** Leaked-password protection
  (HaveIBeenPwned) is off, and signup restrictions are unconfirmed. Neither can
  be changed from SQL or the Management API — they are Supabase dashboard
  toggles and are the last items needing the owner. See `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md`.

- **Net effect of the 2026-07-29 database work.** Supabase's security advisor
  went from **126 findings to 90**. Of the three ERROR-level items, two are
  closed; the remaining one is the `water_meters_hierarchy` SECURITY DEFINER
  *view* (a read-only helper, deliberately left alone). What remains is
  dominated by the 67 `rls_policy_always_true` hits described in the next
  item — the deliberate, product-decision-gated one.

- **Mock-data substitution removed from the last three live paths — 2026-07-29.**
  The 2026-07-25 pass caught the login screen, `/water` and `lib/water-data.ts`,
  but three sites survived and were still swapping fabricated figures in front
  of operators:
  - **`hooks/useDashboardData.ts` was the worst of them, because it substituted
    *partially*.** `isLiveData` was set true if **any one** of the four fetches
    succeeded, then `if (stpData.length === 0) stpData = await getSTPOperations()`
    filled the gaps with demo numbers. So a deck where water and electricity
    read fine but STP came back empty rendered invented STP inlet, TSE and
    revenue figures **under a green "Live Data" badge** — unfalsifiable from the
    UI. Now: demo data loads only when Supabase is unconfigured; a failed read
    is named in an error banner; an empty source renders `—` / "No reading", not
    `0.0k m³`; and a partially-failed deck is no longer written to the session
    cache.
  - **`app/electricity/page.tsx`** swapped in `MOCK` meters on a failed *or
    empty* fetch. Now mirrors the STP page's pattern (which was already correct
    and is the reference).
  - **`app/assets/page.tsx`** rendered a demo asset register on fetch failure.
    Now shows the failure.

- **Four readers queried tables that do not exist — removed 2026-07-29.**
  `getAmcContracts/Expiry/Contacts/Pricing` in `functions/api/contractors.ts`
  read `amc_contracts`, `amc_expiry`, `amc_contacts` and `amc_pricing`. The real
  tables are `amc_contractor_details/expiry/pricing/summary`. Every call had been
  failing and returning `[]` behind a `console.error`. Nothing in the UI called
  them, so nothing broke — but they were four live examples of the swallow-the-
  error pattern. Deleted along with their now-unused `entities/contractor.ts`
  types and `lib/supabase.ts` re-exports.

- **Ticker loop fixed — 2026-07-26. It was jamming on wide screens.**
  The `mb-ticker-*` strips hold two identical copies and animate
  `translateX(0 → -50%)`, i.e. they shift by exactly one copy's width `W`. For
  the viewport `V` to stay covered at the worst point of the cycle you need
  **`W >= V`**. Measured in the browser at 1440px: the strip was **1232px** wide
  holding a **440px** run — so the content slid off and left an ~800px blank gap
  before snapping back. That is what "the ticker is jammed" meant. It looked
  fine on a phone (182px viewport) purely because the run exceeded it there, so
  the bug was invisible on mobile and obvious on a desktop.
  CSS cannot measure, so the rule now lives in `hooks/useTickerLoop.ts`, used by
  both `InspectionTicker` and the Water `DailyBriefing`:
  - **Only scroll when scrolling reveals something.** If `W < V` every stat is
    already on screen; the track gets `data-static="true"`, the duplicate copy
    is hidden and the edge-fade mask is dropped (it was clipping the first
    label). Static never means hidden — all stats still render.
  - **Constant speed, not constant duration.** The fixed 36s made a short run
    crawl at ~12px/s and a long one race; duration is now derived from width at
    40px/s.

- **Briefing strips restyled as a news band — 2026-07-26.** Both tickers now
  read like a TV channel's breaking-news strip: a slim rectangular band with a
  solid caption block on the left and one line of stats beside it. The height
  came down from ~68px to **34px**, and the reason it was tall is worth
  recording — each stat stacked its label *above* its value, so the strip was
  inherently two lines. Stats are now single-line (`.mb-ticker-label` +
  `.mb-ticker-value`), which is what makes the band shape possible.

- **AMC register cutover — 2026-08-04. `Contractor_Tracker` retired as a source.**
  The owner's *Muscat Bay AMC Contract Register* (evidence review 04-Aug-2026)
  became the sole active AMC source, per its own **ACT-012** ("make the AMC
  Register the sole active source; keep one restricted read-only audit snapshot
  until evidence completion", owner: Application / Database).

  The cleanup on 2026-07-26 below fixed *duplication*. It could not fix the
  deeper problem, which the evidence review exposed: **the surviving rows
  asserted commercial figures no document supports.** `Contractor_Tracker` showed
  National Marine as Active at 57,093.12 OMR/yr when no formal contract exists at
  all; Muscat Electronics at 10,461.84 OMR/yr against a 1,071 proposal for an AMC
  that expired 02-Jun-2026; Kalhat at 386,409.718 OMR/yr with no executed
  contract ever located. `contractor_contracts` disagreed with it on the same
  contracts (Muna Noor 1,680 vs 16,000; Tadoom 2,211.60 vs 184.30) and the two
  had no join key, so neither could be reconciled against the other.

  Database (Supabase, all authenticated-only RLS): `amc_register` (10 agreements,
  typed `date`/`numeric`), `amc_open_actions` (12), `amc_excluded_leads` (5 —
  records *why* Tadoom, BUDGET, Iron Mountain, Al Nabaa and the two revenue
  agreements are out), `amc_historical_nouf_2025` (9, audit only).
  `amc_contractor_summary` and `amc_contractor_expiry` were **empty tables the app
  already read**; they are now **views over `amc_register`** (`security_invoker`),
  so they cannot drift from it — this is what finally lit up the Renewals panel,
  which had been rendering its "table holds no rows" fallback since it was built.

  App: `entities/contractor.ts` gains `AmcRegister` + `toTrackerRow()`;
  `getAmcRegister()` is the typed reader and `getContractorTrackerData()` now maps
  through it, which repoints the AMC grid, `useDashboardData` and
  `useOperationalAlerts` in one place rather than rewriting the 1,258-line page.
  Both realtime subscriptions moved to `amc_register`.
  **`ContractorTracker` remains the grid's view model but is `@deprecated` as a
  data source — never read that table again.**

  Two traps worth keeping: `getContractorCounts()` had to become a **prefix**
  match (`ilike 'Active%'`), because the register's own wording includes
  "Active — terms partial" / "Active — term conflict"; the old `.eq('Active')`
  counted 4 of 8 engaged agreements. And **null fee/date means "not evidenced",
  never zero** — only one fee (KONE 11,550) survived review, so ten rows render
  "—" by design. Do not backfill them from the legacy tables.

  Still legacy: the **Contracts tab and the page-header KPIs** read
  `contractor_contracts` (13 rows, includes 2 revenue agreements that belong in a
  revenue register). Not yet repointed.

- **`Contractor_Tracker` cleaned and keyed — 2026-07-26. 42 rows → 19.**
  Management reported unrecognised and duplicated contractors. The table held
  **42 rows for 19 real contracts**, and the root cause was structural: it had
  **no primary key and no uniqueness constraint**, so nothing stopped the same
  contract being inserted twice.
  - **21 unrecognised contractors deleted.** Several were plainly corrupted
    copies of real rows — `Gulf Egypt` ← Gulf **Expert**, `Ras Mountain` ←
    **Iron** Mountain, `Ocean Prime Manufacturing Om` ← **Oman Pumps**
    Manufacturing, `ACME Arabian … "Fit" Maintenance` ← "**Lift**". Two shared
    an identical corruption fingerprint — `OMR/hr` and `VTE` (for VAT), which
    appear nowhere else in the table.
  - **The STP contract was triplicated.** `(CWAN)`, `(OWATCO)` and `LLC` all
    carried *Comprehensive STP Operation and Maintenance* with overlapping
    dates and two different annual values. Email evidence settled it: order ref
    **`MB/COM/L 980-2024` dated 26/01/2024** (contract `CO-SBJ-24-0231`, 750
    m³/day MBR plant) matches the `(OWATCO)` row exactly, and OWATCO's own
    statement of account shows monthly O&M invoices of **3,229.821** (Jan-26)
    and **3,355.795** (Mar-26). That reconciles with 3,103.8/month ex-VAT →
    **37,245.4/year**. The `389,400` figure would require ~32,450/month —
    **ten times** what is actually invoiced — and clusters within 1% of the two
    Facility Management values (Kalhat 386,409.718, Nasco 389,468), i.e. it was
    import noise, not an STP cost. **The STP annual figure is 37,245.4 OMR.**
  - **Statuses corrected:** Celar Water, COMO and Rimal Global → `Canceled`.
    KONE Hiessen and Muscat Electronics → `Expired`; both were flagged `Active`
    with end dates already past (28 Feb 2025 and 2 Jun 2026), which is
    arithmetic rather than a business judgement.
  - **Structure fixed:** added an identity `id` primary key plus a unique
    constraint on **(Contractor, Service Provided)** — the pair, not the
    contractor alone, because Gulf Expert legitimately holds two AMCs. Verified
    by attempting a duplicate insert, which is now rejected with `23505`.
  - **Full pre-change snapshot retained** in `Contractor_Tracker_backup_20260726`
    (all 42 original rows). Every change above is reversible from it.
  - Still unverified and carrying no dates or values: **Genetco** and
    **Uni Gaz**. KONE Hiessen's stored `16,200` also came from a malformed
    `OMR/hr (inc VTE)` cell and should be re-checked against the contract.

- **June 2026 NAMA main-bulk reading — entered 2026-07-19: 57,932 m³**
  (`MB-L1-001`, account `C43659`). This is the NAMA-billed figure from the June
  invoice; it replaced a provisional 59,574 m³ that had been entered 2026-07-04
  (before the bill arrived). Note: `C43659` is the *account number* — the meter_id
  is `MB-L1-001`; an earlier audit query that filtered on `C43659` as the meter_id
  wrongly reported June as "missing". The main-bulk meter is under an active
  over-billing dispute with NAMA, so this figure is the *invoiced* volume, not
  necessarily the true measured supply.
- `Water_System` (underscore) table is an abandoned pre-v2 orphan (columns end
  Feb-26) — not read by anything; candidate for cleanup.
- **Security audit + hardening 2026-07-18 — APPLIED LIVE.** Findings + the
  remaining owner actions are in `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` (repo root). Applied to
  the live DB via `sql/migrations/20260718_security_hardening.sql` +
  `_part2.sql`: RLS tightened so the **anon (public) key can no longer write any
  table** (only the public contractor-application form + scoped own-profile insert
  remain), RLS enabled on the 5 previously-open tables (**0 public tables now
  lack RLS**), `profiles` reads restricted to signed-in users + role
  self-elevation blocked, avatars scoped to each user's folder with a 2 MB/MIME
  limit, and a DB trigger rejects future-dated STP rows. Code (merged to `main`):
  scripts read the `service_role` key from env, `normalizeRole` defaults to
  `viewer` (existing users grandfathered to admin → zero lockout), avatar uploads
  validated + de-orphaned. **Still owner-only (not doable via MCP):** rotate the
  leaked `service_role` key (it bypasses RLS, so it stays dangerous until rotated)
  + purge it from git history; enter the June-2026 NAMA reading; enable
  leaked-password protection; retire the `stp-debug` edge function. Automation is
  unaffected (syncs write via `service_role` / SECURITY DEFINER, bypassing RLS).
- Supabase advisors before hardening (2026-07-18): 133 security / 150 performance.
  After: RLS-disabled (5→0), and **the public anon key can no longer read or write
  any business/PII table** (verified by simulating the anon role — all reads
  return 0; only `professional_applications` INSERT + scoped `profiles` INSERT
  remain anon-accessible by design). Authenticated reads/writes verified intact
  across every module. Residual lower-severity items: mutable function search
  paths, 4 security-definer views, leaked-password protection still off.
- **Database / backup + electricity audit 2026-07-21 — see
  `muscatbay/app/ELECTRICITY_DATA_AUDIT.md`.** Reconciled `electricity_readings`
  against the owner's master spreadsheet
  (`Muscat_Bay_Coast_Electricity_Master_Apr24Apr26.xlsx`): a full row+column
  checksum match proved **the DB already equals the master** (grand total
  3,137,845.2 kWh; identical 60-meter roster and every month). Only 3 cells
  differed (Helipad / Lifting Station 02 / Zone-3 light 17 May-26 `0`→`NULL` =
  "not in service") — reconciled live
  (`sql/migrations/20260721_reconcile_electricity_to_master.sql`). So the odd
  electricity values (Beachwell Jan-26=0 & Mar-25=40, "Bank muscat" Sep-24=**−2**,
  "Bank muscat"+"Bank Muscat ATM" both **744** in Dec-25) are **in the master
  itself** — source-data items to fix at source, NOT DB corruption
  (`sql/fixes/electricity_source_review_20260721.sql`). **Security (3 live holes,
  all closed):** the `*_backup_20260720` Gulf Expert tables had RLS disabled
  (295/12/4 rows anon-readable) — secured then **dropped**; and 3 of the 4
  `v_electricity_*` views were SECURITY DEFINER, leaking consumption to the anon
  key (270/27/60 rows) — switched to `security_invoker`, anon now 0
  (`…_harden_electricity_views_drop_ge_backups.sql`). **Contractor data-loss — RESTORED:**
  `Contractor_Tracker` had dropped from 47 rows to 18 (26 lost contractors — not
  dedup; 18 Active incl. COSMO 562k, Nasco 389k, OWATCO LLC 389k). Restored **24**
  deletions (live 18 → **42**; value ~660k → ~**1.55M OMR/yr**) via
  `…_restore_lost_contractors.sql` + `…_restore_kone_hiessen.sql`. Ambiguities resolved
  with owner: KONE Hiessen restored (distinct); COSMO not restored (COMO/COSMO is
  Expired); "Future Cities (Tadoom)" left out (dup). Contractor backups KEPT until
  past-dated Active statuses are tidied. **Code:** `functions/api/electricity.ts`
  no longer coerces NULL→0 (missing ≠ zero, per the master's empty-vs-0 rule);
  188 tests pass. **Also flagged:** STP 2025 has 1 negative TSE reading;
  `v_electricity_monthly_pivot` hardcodes months.
- Capacity (2026-07-18): DB **28 MB / 500 MB** (5.7%), Storage **3.1 MB / 1 GB**
  (0.3%) — Free plan, ample headroom, limit not being approached.
- Monthly loads for electricity/STP still arrive via hand-run SQL in
  `sql/migrations/` — same class of manual step water had before 2026-07-03.
- **STP future-dated row — RESOLVED 2026-07-18.** The stray `2027-05-06` row
  (which had re-synced from AITable on 2026-07-07) was deleted from both
  `stp_operations` and `stp_daily_reports`, and a DB trigger
  (`stp_reject_future_dates`, in `_part2.sql`) now silently drops any row dated
  after "today" in Oman on both tables — so it cannot re-appear via the daily
  AITable sync. Max STP date is back to the correct latest real day. For full
  cleanliness the record should still be corrected in the AITable source
  (datasheet `dsteHeHSeZ59QTougo`). The in-progress current month (Jul-26) is
  legitimate live daily data and is kept as-is.
- **Design-system debt found in the 2026-07-25 consistency pass (reported, not
  fixed — none of it is user-visible today):**
  - `muscatbay/app/tailwind.config.ts` is **dead configuration**. Tailwind 4 only
    loads a JS config via an explicit `@config` directive, and `globals.css` has
    none — so the `fontSize` / `borderRadius` / `boxShadow` / `colors` blocks in
    that file have no effect. Fonts and tokens actually come from the
    `@theme inline` block in `app/globals.css`. `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3 and
    `CLAUDE.md` both describe the config as wired; either delete the file or add
    `@config "../tailwind.config.ts";` — do not "fix" the docs to match.
  - `ExceptionsRegister` in `components/shared/inspection.tsx` is now unused
    (every module renders `components/inspection/findings-register.tsx`), but it
    still hardcodes the retired `Owner` / `Status: "Open"` columns. It is a live
    export, so it can be re-imported by accident — delete it in a follow-up.
  - `lib/config.ts` `CHART_COLORS` and the `color` fields in `lib/mock-data.ts`
    still hold raw hexes. Neither is read by any rendered chart today.
  - `BRAND_DESIGN.md` §3 and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3 still name **Inter** as the
    font family; `app/layout.tsx` (and `CLAUDE.md`) ship **Geist**. Separately,
    `BRAND_DESIGN.md` §2.3/§8 give text-on-brand-teal as `#FFFFFF`, which is
    ~1.5:1 on `--secondary` `#A1D1D5` and contradicts that doc's own §10
    accessibility table; `globals.css` and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §2.1 use
    `--secondary-foreground` `#1F2937` (~10:1) and the 2026-07-25 pass
    standardised every teal surface on that. Both are doc edits an owner should
    make — the code is already correct.

## 4b. O&M scope — what this app deliberately is not

A capability assessment against a normal CMMS was run on 2026-07-25. The app
is a **monitoring, analysis and identification** platform. It has 9 live write
paths, only 3 of which record business data (a contract PDF link, the public
contractor application, and a user's own profile). Absent by decision, not by
oversight: work orders, PPM scheduling engines, task assignment, due dates,
SLA timers, close-out evidence, spares/procurement, permit-to-work, incident
registers, and any audit trail of resolution.

**Do not add these without an explicit instruction from the owner** —
management confirmed on 2026-07-25 that issues are actioned on the floor and
that the app's job is to surface them, not to track them. Fake affordances
that imply tracking (hardcoded owners, `Status: "Open"` chips) were removed
for exactly this reason and should not be reintroduced.

Genuinely useful data that exists but is unsurfaced, if ever wanted:
`fire_quotations` (4 rows) + `fire_quotation_items` (7 rows) are real, modelled
tables that no screen reads.

## 5. In-flight work (open PRs)

- **#49 Front-end & O&M review remediation + Expo mobile foundation** — draft,
  active. Contents described in §2 (2026-07-25). Also introduces `mobile/`, an
  **Expo Router native app**: the web app is a PWA and a PWA cannot be listed
  on the App Store, so store distribution requires a native binary. Reuses the
  pure-TypeScript domain layer (`entities/`, `lib/`, `functions/api/`) via
  Metro `watchFolders` rather than duplicating it. Target is **internal-only
  distribution** (Apple Business Manager custom app), not the public store.
  Immediate priority is running in **Expo Go**, which needs no paid Apple
  membership; iOS push notifications require a development build and degrade
  honestly in Expo Go. Still outstanding: Apple Developer Program membership
  ($99, not yet purchased), EAS credentials, store assets.
- **Base44-style file reorganisation — DONE (2026-07-25).** See §1a. Remaining
  from this wave: a final colour/design-consistency pass, and test coverage for
  the six modules that still have no test file.

- **Security & data-integrity hardening (Phase 1) — MERGED (#43) + APPLIED
  2026-07-18.** Code merged to `main`; both SQL migrations applied to the live DB
  (see §4). Remaining owner-only actions (rotate `service_role` key, enter June
  NAMA reading, enable leaked-password protection, retire `stp-debug`) are in
  `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md`. **UI unification (tables/fonts/colours) is the
  planned Phase 2** — not yet started.
- **#28 Senior-management water dashboard** — new default "Management" tab on
  `/water` (YTD KPIs + latest daily snapshot). Active, awaiting review/merge.
- **#21 3D app logo + STP plant twin** — draft; new logo assets + Three.js twin.
- **#6 Grafana → Supabase daily water sync workflow** — draft; needs 7 repo
  secrets before merge (see PR body).
- **#5 / #4** — stale (May-26 daily backfill already applied differently; codex
  lint fixes) — review for close-or-rebase.
