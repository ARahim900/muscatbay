I'll help you write out the full code for WaterSystem.tsx, replacing all placeholders with the actual data. However, I notice that the file is quite large and the full code would exceed the length limit of a single response. Would you like me to:

1. Split the code into multiple responses that you can concatenate together
2. Focus on specific sections that need to be fixed
3. Share a different way to handle this

Please let me know your preference and I'll proceed accordingly.
